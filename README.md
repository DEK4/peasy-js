#Getting started

You can get started by reviewing the [getting started example](https://github.com/peasy/Peasy.NET/wiki#the-simplest-possible-example) on the Peasy wiki.  The wiki also covers in-depth how-to's, general framework design, and usage scenarios.

A simple sample can be viewed [here](https://github.com/peasy/peasy-js/blob/master/src/sample.js) that showcases creating a [business service](), custom [command](), [business rules](), and wiring them up.  The sample also showcases how to consume the service.  From a command line, just run: ```node sample.js```
